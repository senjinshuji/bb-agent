## 🔄 Detailed Workflow

### Phase 1: Strategic Planning & Analysis
**Owner**: MD (Marketing Director)

1. **Product Analysis** → `product_analysis.md`
   - Product features, competitive analysis, market positioning

2. **Target Audience Analysis** → `target_analysis.md`
   - Demographic segmentation, behavioral patterns, purchase motivations

3. **Copywriter Instructions** → `copywriter_instructions.md`
   - Production guidelines, key messages, tone settings, 5-script directive
   - Loop 2+ includes improvements based on previous evaluations

4. **Persona Evaluation Criteria** → `persona_evaluation_criteria.md`
   - Evaluation axes derived from top-performing scripts
   - 100-point scoring breakdown

5. **Creative Strategy** → `creative_strategy.md`
   - Brand positioning, differentiation strategy, expression guidelines

### Phase 2: Personality Formation & File Management
**Owner**: CD (Creative Director)

1. **Writer Personality MD Files**
   ```bash
   writer1_loop[N].md  # Emotion-focused personality
   writer2_loop[N].md  # Logic-focused personality
   writer3_loop[N].md  # Casual-focused personality
   ```

2. **Persona Personality MD Files**
   ```bash
   persona1_loop[N].md  # 30-50s housewife evaluator
   persona2_loop[N].md  # 25-45s business evaluator
   persona3_loop[N].md  # 18-30s Gen Z evaluator
   ```

### Phase 3: Mass Production
**Owner**: Writers 1-3

Each writer produces 5 scripts based on their personality MD file:
- **Writer1**: Emotion-driven scripts (storytelling, empathy, inspiration)
- **Writer2**: Logic-driven scripts (data, efficacy, comparison, ROI)
- **Writer3**: Casual scripts (friendly, trendy, SNS-optimized, humor)

Total output: 15 scripts per loop

### Phase 4: Multi-Perspective Evaluation
**Owner**: Personas 1-3

Each persona evaluates all 15 scripts (100 points each):
- **Persona1**: Empathy (40), Familiarity (30), Purchase Intent (30)
- **Persona2**: Logic (40), Efficiency (30), Credibility (30)
- **Persona3**: Trendiness (40), SNS Appeal (30), Virality (30)

Total evaluations: 45 per loop

### Phase 5: Integrated Analysis
**Owner**: CD (Creative Director)

Produces `integrated_analysis_loop[N].md` containing:
1. Overall scores for all 15 scripts
2. Persona-specific evaluation trends
3. Writer performance analysis
4. Common elements in high-scoring scripts
5. Improvement recommendations
6. Next loop strategy proposals

### Phase 6: Loop Improvement
**Owner**: MD (Marketing Director)

Updates strategic documents based on analysis:
- Refined copywriter instructions
- Enhanced evaluation criteria
- Evolved creative strategy
